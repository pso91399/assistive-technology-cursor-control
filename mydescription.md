# ARIA and Assitive Technologies (ARIA-AT)

This repository maintains a test suite and harness for assessing assistive technology support of ARIA. This project is managed by the [ARIA-AT Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/aria-at) in 
coordination with the [Authoring Practices Task Force](https://w3.org/WAI/ARIA/task-forces/practices/) of the [ARIA Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/). The W3C staff contact is Daniel Montalvo.

## Scope and Method

The initial scope of this test suite is manual testing of a select set of desktop screen readers. Tests are written as assertions of expected screen behaviour when using example implementations of design
patterns in the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/).
